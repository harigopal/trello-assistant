# Tassi?

**T**rello **Assi**stant. It (is supposed to) automate some of the repetitive tasks I find myself doing every week, checking the burn-down of our Trello board at [SV.CO](https://www.sv.co), and such.

## Environment variables

1. `TRELLO_KEY` - Trello developer key
2. `TRELLO_TOKEN` - Authenticated Trello token for above key.
3. `TRELLO_USER` - Trello username corresponding to above key and token.

## Execution

go run github.com/harigopal/tassi.go

.. or just use the _binary_.

## Why?

Because [developers are lazy](http://threevirtues.com/).
